This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin's handling of `removeIf` when used with `MutableMap` values. The `removeIf` function works as expected on `MutableList`, removing elements that satisfy the predicate. However, when applied to the values of a `MutableMap`, it unexpectedly does not remove the corresponding key-value pairs from the map. The `bug.kt` file contains the code demonstrating this behavior. The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a corrected implementation.
